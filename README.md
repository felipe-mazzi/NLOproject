How to read:
1. Begin with the introduction in the pdf file titled "AA-QPM Introduction"
2. Then launch the Mathematica Notebook

I included a PDF verstion of the Mathematica Notebook as it is inteded to appear for you. Wolfram Cloud has some issues in displaying the graphics, so if possible use Wolfram Mathematica Desktop App.
