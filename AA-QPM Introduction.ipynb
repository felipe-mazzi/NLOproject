This is, to the best of my knowledge, an original approach towards realizing nonlinear optical processes between phase-mismatched optical modes in integrated photonics. In traditional Quasi-Phase-Matching (QPM), the ferroelectric domains of a crystal are periodically inverted with the correct periodicity to compensate the modal mismatch. Alternatively, in AA-QPM, the effective nonlinear susceptibility is itself modulated by the path shape of the guiding structures.\n","\n","The contents of the project start with this brief theoretical introduction, and is followed by the actual code in the attached Wolfram Mathematica notebook.

The equations tells us three main parameters that contribute to this dependence: (1) the effective nonlinear susceptibility, that is, the nonlinearity \"experienced\" by the optical mode in a specific polarization and propagation direction, (2) the phase-matching term, represented in the complex exponential, which implies that exclusively \"forward\" (rather than \"reverse\") conversion of power between modes can only happen when $\\Delta=2\\beta^{(\\omega)}-\\beta^{(2\\omega)}$, and (3) a spatial overlap integral, which also dictates the strength of the interaction by measuring the similarity in the spatial profiles of the optical modes.\n","\n","\n","The technique introduced in this project requires us to bring all this components together to compensate each other towards an efficient nonlinear conversion.
